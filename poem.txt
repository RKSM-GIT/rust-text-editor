Text editors, with their bright, clean screens,fffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffff
Transform chaos into organized dreams.
A few simple clicks, and text starts to flow,
Formatting, correcting, in a steady glow.
They make life easy, and progress so fast.

With every keystroke, a world is made,
All that's needed is a sharp cascade.
No need for paper, no ink to waste,
Just pure efficiency, quick to embrace.
Text editors, you speed up the day!
This is a new Line!
